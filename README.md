Plant Leaf Disease Detection AI Model
This project is an AI model for detecting plant leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architecture. The model is built using Python and the Keras library, and is trained on a dataset of images of healthy and diseased plant leaves. The trained model is then integrated into a web application using FastAPI to allow users to test the model's accuracy on their own images.

Requirements
To run the plant leaf disease detection AI model, you will need the following:

Python 3.x
Keras
TensorFlow
FastAPI
You can install these dependencies using pip.

Running the Model
To run the model, first clone the repository to your local machine. Then, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

css
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --reload
This will start the FastAPI server, which you can access by navigating to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser. From here, you can upload an image of a plant leaf and test the model's accuracy.

Training the Model
If you want to train the model on your own dataset, you can do so by adding your images to the data directory and modifying the train.py file to reflect the changes. Once you have added your images and modified the script, run the following command to train the model:

Copy code
python train.py
The trained model will be saved as a file in the model directory.
